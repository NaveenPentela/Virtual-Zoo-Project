# Virtual Zoo Project

The Virtual Zoo project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the management of a zoo. It aims to educate zoo employees about the care requirements and costs associated with different animal species. The program allows users to initialize a zoo with various animals, each with unique needs, and simulate their care over a virtual week.

## Educational Objectives:

- Understanding class and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Developing methods for user input and program interaction.
- Implementing logical structures to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Managing and tracking multiple variables and their interactions over time.
